linkedin-j
==========
A Java wrapper for LinkedIn APIs. 
Originally from  http://code.google.com/p/linkedin-j/

I cloned it into git.

The original author also had git clone but it is old when compared to the one available on code.google.com.

To start, I want to keep master untouched. And I am making my custom changes on the 1.0-SNAPSHOT branch
